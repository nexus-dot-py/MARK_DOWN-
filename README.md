# MARK_DOWN-


## **Introduction**
***

**Hello** this my new *markdown page*

Nearly all Markdown applications support the basic syntax outlined in the original Markdown language.

There are minor variations and discrepancies between Markdown processors — those are noted inline wherever possible.

There are two types of list in **MD**

- ORDERED LIST

      1 It is used when order has importance
      2 It uses numbers

- UNORDERED LIST

      1 It is used when order has no importance
      
      2 It uses symbols


            >Blockquotes can contain other Markdown formatted elements.
            >
            >Not all elements can be used — you’ll need to experiment to see which ones work.
